 * Pure state + rasterisation, like psx_video_menu: it reads no guest memory and
 * touches no SDL/GL. The host computes the rank (main.cpp owns the addresses
 * and the formula), pushes it here, and the renderer composites the image.
 *
 * The canvas is authored in GUEST pixels — the same 320x240 space the game
 * draws in — so the meter can sit beside the FIELD box at any window size. The
 * renderer maps it into the letterboxed game rect.
