/* MODS > CARD DROPS — Yu-Gi-Oh! Forbidden Memories.
 *
 * Awards N cards for a won duel instead of 1 by re-running the GAME'S OWN
 * drop roll, tracks what the duel granted, republishes the chest's "New!"
 * flags so they mean "this duel", and renders the awarded cards as an extra
 * page on the RESULTS OF DUEL screen using the game's own text engine.
 *
 * All guest-side knowledge — the hooked function addresses, the RAM map, the
 * text-stream encoding — lives in the .c file. This header is the whole
 * interface: the host registers the hooks, ticks the module once a frame,
 * pushes the menu setting in, and reads state out for the debug server.
 *
 * The module talks to the guest only through mod_plugins.h and cpu_state.h,
 * and to the screen only through psx_cd_overlay.h. It owns no SDL or GL.
