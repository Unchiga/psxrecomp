/* Sprites lifted out of the game's own VRAM by tools/sprite_extract.py.
 *
 * They are BAKED rather than read from VRAM at draw time on purpose: the
 * POW/TEC badge and the rank letters are results-screen assets and are not
 * resident while a duel is running, which is exactly when the rank meter
 * draws. Baking also means the meter never has to track a CLUT or care what
 * the guest happens to have loaded.
 *
 * ARGB8888, row-major, alpha 0 where the PS1 palette entry was 0x0000 (the
 * transparent colour), so they composite straight over the frame. The game
 * draws all of them with primitive colour 0x808080 — neutral modulation — so
 * the stored pixels are exactly what appears on screen.
