 *
 * Sits just above the hand and answers the question the game never does: what
 * do these cards make? With nothing picked it names the best fusion the hand
 * can reach; as cards are picked it shows the card that would stand if they
 * were summoned now, which IS the running fusion, because the game folds a
 * multi-card summon two at a time in pick order.
 *
 * Same shape as the rank meter and the CARD DROPS tags: a small ARGB canvas
 * authored in GUEST pixels that the renderer maps into the letterboxed game
 * rect. Pure state and rasterisation — no GL, and no guest reads of its own;
 * psx_fusion_assist supplies the content.
