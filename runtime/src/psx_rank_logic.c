/* Live duel-rank logic -- see psx_rank_logic.h.

 *
 * Yu-Gi-Oh! Forbidden Memories grades every duel on a single 0-99 score and
 * shows it only on the RESULTS OF DUEL screen, after it is too late to steer.
 * The score is not reconstructed at the end though: the game keeps every input
 * counter live for the whole duel and func_80021598 merely sums them, so the
 * same arithmetic can be run every frame.
 *
 *     score = 50 + (s8)block[+0x00]              victory bonus, already points
 *     for kind in 0..9: score += lookup(kind, counter[kind])
 *
 *     lookup(kind, v):                           func_80021558
 *         p = 0x801798A8 + kind * 20             5 x (s16 threshold, s16 delta)
 *         while (v >= p->threshold) p += 4
 *         return p->delta
 *
 * Verified against the game's own answer: at duel end func_80021598 writes the
 * finished scores to 0x80179A04 (you) and 0x80179A08 (opponent), and a live
 * duel recomputed 86/84 against an oracle of 86/84 while the results screen
 * displayed POW / A Rank — 86 being in the 89-80 A-POW band.
 *
 * The coefficient table is NOT in the EXE image; it arrives with a disc load,
 * so it reads as zeros outside a duel and is validated rather than trusted. */
