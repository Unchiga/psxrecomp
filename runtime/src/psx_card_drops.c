/* ---- MODS > CARD DROPS ----------------------------------------------------
 *
 * Award N cards for a won duel instead of 1, by re-running the GAME'S OWN drop
 * roll — not by picking cards ourselves. That is the whole point: the pool a
 * drop comes from depends on the opponent and on your duel rank, and the game
 * already encodes both. Rolling here would mean reimplementing that and
 * silently drifting from it.
 *
 * The two guest routines, established by write-tracing the trunk during a real
 * duel reward and then reading the generated C for the enclosing functions
 * (2026-08-17):
 *
 *   func_80021810(a0 = tier) -> v0 = card id
 *       table = 0x8017878C + tier*1460; roll = rng() & 0x7FF + 1; walks 722
 *       cumulative n-in-2048 weights and returns the first index whose running
 *       sum reaches the roll, +1. Returns 0 if the table is empty. The table
 *       belongs to the CURRENT opponent and is reloaded per duel, so calling
 *       this again draws from exactly the pool the game would have used.
 *
 *   func_80021894(a0 = card id)
 *       trunk byte at 0x801D024F + card_id, +1, capped at 251.
 *
 * `tier` is recomputed the same way the game does at 0x80021C44..0x80021C58,
 * from two bytes in the duel-results block — rather than captured from a live
 * register, so this does not depend on having observed the game's own call.
 *
 * Hooked at func_80021894's ENTRY, filtered to the duel-drop call site by $ra.
 * The extra cards are awarded BEFORE the game's own (order is irrelevant — the
 * total is what matters), which keeps this a pure prologue: we never have to
 * interfere with the call already in flight. */

/* ---- extended "New!" list -------------------------------------------------
 *
 * The chest's New! label and its sort-to-top both read a per-card flag byte at
 * 0x8010606A + card_id (UI work buffer, NOT the save struct). The guest fills
 * it at the top of func_800323F8, the chest display-list builder: for each
 * card 1..722 it clears the byte (sb $zero at 0x800324B4), then re-marks the
 * cards found in the 16-slot ring at 0x801D07BC that the award routine pushes.
 * So no matter how many cards CARD DROPS grants, at most the ring's 16 ever
 * show as New!. Both readers (0x80031A7C, and the sort at 0x80033004) only
 * test the byte for nonzero.
 *
 * The extension therefore only has to REWRITE that array between the
 * builder's flag pass and the first read. That window is crossed by a guest
 * call: the builder jals its sort/insert body func_80032C48 (links 0x800325E4
 * and 0x80032710), and the flag consumption happens inside that body. So:
 * hook the BUILDER entry to arm, hook the SORT entry (filtered to the
 * builder's two call sites by $ra) to write the whole array, first call only
 * — 1 for each card the last duel awarded, 0 for every other card.
 *
 * Clearing the rest is the point, not housekeeping. The ring is a ROLLING
 * 16-slot list that the game never empties per duel, so stock "New!" means
 * "the last 16 cards you acquired", spanning as many duels as that took. An
 * add-only overlay therefore left up to 15 cards from previous duels labelled
 * New — and, because our set was then a subset of the ring, changed nothing
 * at all below 16 cards, making the whole feature a silent no-op at low
 * settings. Rewriting makes "New!" mean "this duel" at every setting.
 *
 * The byte is a recency RANK, not a boolean: the guest walks the ring writing
 * 16 (oldest) down to 1 (newest, at the ring head), and the chest sorts on it.
 * Writing 1 for all of this duel's cards says "all equally newest", which is
 * what groups them at the top.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT done by patching the guest's per-card clear to NOP and
 * replaying it host-side: psx_mod_write_code_word inside the 256-byte window
 * behind the builder's entry makes dirty_ram_text_native_ok() sticky-diverge
 * the function to the dirty-RAM interpreter, and interpreted dispatches never
 * run psx_mod_function_entry — the patch would disarm its own hook after one
 * build. This way modifies no guest code at all. */

/* ---- CARD DROPS results page (page 4 of the results screen) --------------
 *
 * The results screen already cycles 3 pages on D-pad Left/Right; this adds a
 * fourth listing every card the duel just awarded, one row per distinct card.
 * The two wrap constants in the nav (func_800218F0, 0x80021FB0..50) cannot be
 * code-patched (dirty-RAM divergence would disarm every hook), so the cycle is
 * extended from OUTSIDE the nav:
 *
 *   - func_800218F0 entry (once per frame): snapshot the PRE-press page byte
 *     RESULT[55]. The nav runs later in the same invocation, so the snapshot
 *     is what the player was LOOKING AT when they pressed.
 *   - func_80021480 entry (the page apply, $a0 = post-nav page): in a 4-page
 *     cycle only the two transitions INTO page 3 land wrong (2+Right -> stock
 *     0, 0+Left -> stock 2); leaving page 3 lands right on its own (byte 3:
 *     Right 3+1=4 -> 0, Left 3+1-2=2). When a transition should enter page 3,
 *     rewrite $a0 and the page byte to 3 and arm the widget override. The
 *     guest body then renders "page 3": it reads its content id from
 *     byte[RESULT+52+page], and for page 3 that byte IS the page byte (52+3 =
 *     55), i.e. content id 3 — garbage, which is exactly why the next hook
 *     exists.
 *   - func_800393B0 entry (widget draw, $a0 = widget): the apply set up UI
 *     widget 0 with content id 3; before the body's init resolves that id
 *     into a stream cursor, replace the state so it decodes OUR stream
 *     instead: cursor word at obj+0, decode-pending obj[82]=1, cursor slot
 *     obj[88]=0, and bit14 of the flags half at obj+52 so the body's own init
 *     (which would re-resolve id 3) is skipped.
 *
 * Gate: what THIS duel actually awarded (total > 1), recorded at roll time by
 * the tracker above — never the live slider, which the player can change
 * mid-duel. At total <= 1 every hook returns before touching anything and the
 * screen stays bit-for-bit stock.
 *
 * The stream is composed host-side into the chest's New!-flag work buffer
 * (0x8010606A, 723 bytes): UI scratch, rebuilt by the chest builder on every
 * chest open, and the chest and results screens are mutually exclusive, so
 * the results page owning it while on screen collides with nothing. */
