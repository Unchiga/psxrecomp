/* psx_fusion_assist.c — the duel side of the fusion assistant.
 *
 * ---- where the hand lives -------------------------------------------------
 *
 * The duel keeps one 28-byte record per card in play, based at 0x801A7AE4.
 * That address is not a guess: func_8001A280, the routine that resolves a
 * two-card summon, forms it from immediates —
 *
 *     s2 = 0x8015C424, s0 = 0x00048000
 *     v0 = slot*28 + s2 + s0            = slot*28 + 0x801A4424
 *     lh a0, 14016(v0)                  = slot*28 + 0x801A7AE4
 *
 * — and hands the two halfwords it reads there straight to the fusion lookup.
 * So this array is, by construction, exactly what the game fuses. Confirmed by
 * writing ids into it and watching the summon produce what those ids fuse to.
 *
 * Fields used (all u16):
 *     +0  card id
 *     +2  attack
 *     +4  defence
 *     +10 flags; 0x8000 on a live card, cleared the moment it is consumed by a
 *         summon, and 0x8400 once it is a monster ON the field
 *     +12 the record's own slot index, 0-based
 *
 * ---- which slots are actually IN the hand ---------------------------------
 *
 * Not answerable from the records. The hand refills to five every turn, so at
 * rest slots 0..4 with the live flag are right — but during a summon the game
 * keeps spent materials in their records, flag and all, for the whole
 * animation. Measured: after picking slots 0 and 1 and summoning, the records
 * still read all five live for several seconds while the cards were visibly
 * gone. Worse, two slots that were being drawn and two that were not had
 * byte-identical record shapes, so no field in the record decides it.
 *
 * The selection table does decide it. Its per-slot entry holds the slot's card
 * OBJECT at +0, and the game tears those pointers down the instant the hand
 * stops being pickable: they read as five live pointers while the player is
 * choosing, and as five zeros from the first frame of the summon onward.
 * Checked against the game's own hand display pass (func_800170C8, called once
 * per card actually in the hand) across a turn: the two agree exactly while
 * the hand is pickable, which is the only time this feature has anything to
 * say. During the animation the gate reports an empty hand, which is the
 * honest answer — there is nothing to pick.
 *
 * Hooking the display pass would be the other way to do it, and was tried
 * first. It needs 0x800170C8 added to game.toml's `mod_function_entry_funcs`
 * and the whole game regenerated, because that hook is an opt-in allow-list
 * baked into the recompiled C. A pointer that is already in RAM, already
 * per-slot, and already means exactly "this hand position is pickable" is not
 * worth a regenerate.

/* ---- the selection the player is building ---------------------------------
 *
 * Picking cards with Up does NOT touch the card records — nothing in the whole
 * 28-byte array moves — so the selection lives elsewhere: a parallel table of
 * five 12-byte entries at 0x800EA030, one per hand slot.
 *
 *     +0  the slot's card object, always present
 *     +4  the selection marker object; ZERO while the card is unpicked
 *     +9  the 1-based order in which this card was picked
 *
 * with the number picked mirrored in a byte at 0x800E9F25. Measured by picking
 * slots 4, 1 and 3 in that order and watching entries appear with ordinals
 * 1, 2, 3. Pressing Up on an already-picked card is a no-op, not a toggle.
 *
 * ---- and the order the chain folds in --------------------------------------
 *
 * SELECTION order, not left-to-right hand order. Picking slot 4, then 1, then
 * 3 (Maiden of the Moonlight, Ganigumo, Beaked Snake — no fusion among them)
 * summoned Beaked Snake, the last card PICKED. Folding by hand position would
 * have ended on Maiden of the Moonlight, so the two hypotheses are cleanly
 * separated and this is the one that happened. That also pins the fold's base
 * case: when a step does not fuse, the incoming card is what stands.
